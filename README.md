# SeventhGate
This is a fork of https://seventhgate.codeplex.com/ with UX translated into Traditional Chinese.

SeventhGate enables Windows 7 and Server 2008R2 computers with wireless network card to turn into simple wireless routers. SeventhGate waits in system tray for You to start the network. If no longer needed, just turn it off and let Your machine free up all the resources.
The idea of wireless hosted network (proper name of Windows feature utilized by SeventhGate) is described here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd815243(VS.85).aspx

##System Requirements
SeventhGate can run only on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008R2. This is due to the fact, that wifi virtualization was introduced just with those two OSes. In case SeventhGate is run under older systems, whole GUI becomes disabled and proper information is displayed. Also, .Net Framework 3.5 is required.

##Installation
SeventhGate comes with an automatic installer built with InnoSetup.

##Usage
Run SeventhGate.exe, connect a wireless dongle, choose your wired connection and enjoy free Wi-Fi. Administrative right is required for SeventhGate to work.

##Known Issues
SeventhGate has been tested on Windows 7 successfully. However, it seems to not work properly on Windows 8 or higher Windows versions. I am aware of this issue and I am currently looking for a workaround.
